The systems and algorithms developed in this work focus on means for remote monitoring using smart phones. The smart phone based remote symptom monitoring system called e-ESAS serves as a working tool to monitor essential symptoms of patients with breast cancer by doctors. The activity detection system allows a remote observer to monitor basic human activities. For the activity detection system, the majority voting fusion technique in multi-sensor architecture is evaluated for eight activities in both single and multiple subjects cases. Time-delay embedding with expectationmaximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model was studied using data from multiple single sensor cases.
