I taught the following two courses in **Spring 2020**.

Machine Learning (CSCI 4957/5957)
======
 This course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning topics.  This course introduces several fundamental concepts of machine learning. The objective of this is to familiarize the audience about core topics of machine learning including i) Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, etc.) ii) Unsupervised Learning (clustering, recommender systems) and iii) Best practices of machine learning

Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI 1250)
======
An introduction to object-oriented programming concepts: good programming style, algorithms, documentation, and elementary data structures. We will use Java as a vehiclefor introducing these programming concepts. Using computers in lab to design, code, debug, and execute programs is an integral part of the course
