**Abstract:** Locomotion is a feature of all animals. Whereas quadruped are fast and stable, human’s bipedal gait is less stable and less efficient. Human gait analysis is going on for a long time. Such analysis usually used force data applied on the ground during different phases of gait. In this paper, we have analyzed the pressure data collected from pressure sensors placed on shoes along with accelerometer data collected from cell phones during walking activity. We identified different phases of walking activity using the pressure data. We also have developed a biomechanical model of gait based on the pressure and acceleration data.
