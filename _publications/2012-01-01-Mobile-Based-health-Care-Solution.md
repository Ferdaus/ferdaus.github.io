**Abstract:**  Breast cancer patients in advanced stage of the disease need palliative care as well as traditional treatment which aim to cure and prevent cancer. For such patients, treatments and interventions concentrating on reducing the suffering and improving the quality of life might be the best possible alternative. In this paradigm, long term care is provided through an adaptive feedback-oriented treatment mechanism. It is essential that patients be assessed regularly and if needed, adjustments to the treatments be made without delay. This whole issue is almost absent in rural scenario of developing countries like Bangladesh. Here we have proposed a mobile and sensor based solution named AutoCare, which has been outlined with the assistance of International Breast Cancer Research Foundation (IBCRF). As part of AutoCare we have designed and deployed a mobile based remote patient monitoring system named e-ESAS. We have also summarized the desired design principals of such systems found through 3 field studies in rural Bangladesh.
